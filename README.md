# poem called love

This is an interactive transforming version of Alex Dimitrov's ever-evolving [poem on love](https://www.alexdimitrov.com/love) that uses the [telescopic text open-source library](https://github.com/jackyzha0/telescopic-text) to transform the poem between the different lines.

This is powered by a private Coda doc that uses the Twitter Pack to live sync the tweets from [alex's twitter account](https://twitter.com/apoemcalledlove) and shape them into the input expected by the library. Currently, it's a manual process to update it, but it can be automated via Github Actions in the future.
